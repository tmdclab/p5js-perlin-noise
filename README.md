# Animated Perlin Noise Pattern

This repository contains a creative coding project that generates an animated pattern using Perlin noise in p5.js. The code creates a mesmerizing visual effect as the pattern expands and contracts, with each shape influenced by Perlin noise to create an organic, natural look.

## Features
- **Smooth Animation**: The pattern expands and contracts over time, giving a dynamic pulsing effect.
- **Perlin Noise Variation**: Each point on the pattern's shape edge is influenced by Perlin noise, creating a unique and evolving pattern.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Easily adjust parameters to change the shape, size, and speed of the animation.
- **Fading Effect**: A semi-transparent overlay adds a smooth fading trail, enhancing the visual appeal.

## How to Use
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to see the animation in action.
3. To modify the pattern, edit the `sketch.js` file. You can adjust parameters like:
   - **TOTAL_ANGLE**: Number of degrees for the full shape.
   - **circleRadius**: Controls the flower's radius.
   - **radiusDirection**: Controls the speed and direction of the pulsing effect.
   - **noiseFactor**: Modify to change how much Perlin noise affects the shape.
